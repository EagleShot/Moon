Before the beginning of my research, the free software I used was for gimmick things that I needed for single use. They were scripts available online for purposes like renaming a whole bunch of files or downloading a lot of data from a website. With my senior seminar, we had a formal introduction to open source and free software. Bioinformatics research is split between pharmaceutical companies who can use expensive software and the research community that wants to save as much money as possible. Being from a small lab, we didn't have enough money to support the wet lab, buy computational hardware and then again spend money on software. I was thus tasked with developing a state-of-the-art analysis pipeline which did not cost money. I was surprised how easy that was. There is a lot of resources available that were free. Some of the most significant contributors I encountered were John Hopkins and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the National Cancer Institute. While sensitive data was protected, it was easy to get access after following a streamlined process.

After my work is complete, I am planning to release all my scripts and data that did not originate from protected data for free under the MIT license. I previously thought that I wouldn't gain anything from other people using my code, but I was wrong. I am thrilled that I was wrong. When others use my code, I get free feedback from people who are interested in similar things. This leads to overall better quality code, vital connections, and sharing of ideas. It also allows others to do work faster without having to reinvent the wheel which is beneficial to everyone involved. Most of the tools I used in my work was free and open source, and without that code, I would have been able to do only 10% of my work.
