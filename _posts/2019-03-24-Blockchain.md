I am a strong believer in democracy and the democratic process but every time there is an election, there are allegations of hackings and tampering of voting machines. It is essential that the voting mechanism is protected from all forms of malfeasance. This is where private blockchains can be used to preserve votes and ensure their integrity. Blockchains are immutable transactional records that are protected by the collective computing power of the machines. In a private blockchain, the machine which can enter can be easily managed. Any nodes that start to attack the history can also be easily detected.

Given the private nature of the blockchain, a 51% attack can be ruled out. Each node contributes an equal hashrate with a very low probability of bad blocks. The sequence of blocks can be verified and thus a voter can later check their votes too with their private keys. These keys can also be linked to the voters' biometrics. Updates to the machines can be made on the fly by a central authority that has enough computing power which the government can, with its vast recources. A version of this blockchain can be made open source to security researchers that can help strengthen it by pentration testing and patching the issues.

Blockchain's most common use right now is cryptocurrency. While it has its uses, blockchain is so much. This is just one use case for its untapped potentiality. It can be used for sharing health care records in hospital networks, preserving financial transactions within an institution and preserving documents of imporatance to prevent them from being altered.
