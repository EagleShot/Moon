The debate between government surveillance, civil liberties, and privacy has been continuing for decades. With the exponential growth of smartphones and the internet, a large proportion of the population is being tracked at all times. Their interests can be calculated, their routes predicted. More importantly with the big data that is available, some impressive predictive modes can be created. The problem with this kind of access to data is oversight. At this moment, we don't even know the real power of AI. Every day, new models and techniques are being invented and remarkable results achieved.

The current consensus in AI is nicely illustrated by Peter Norvig's paper [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf). Even simple machine learning techniques can be used with enough data to replicate the results of much more complicated algorithms which have limited data. Many governments have started to stockpile on citizen data in the hopes of mining the data to general insights, but because of the technical nature of this information and the rapid developments in AI, legislation is far behind.

So the question I want to discuss: "Is there unalienable data that the people can protect that the government should not be able to access?". While I wish I had a clear answer, I, unfortunately, do no. According to me, the government should be able to access data when they have a reasonable reason to do so. This should be approved by the courts, and there should be warrants. Mass surveillance is not the way to go. It curbs creativity and expression. There are parts of one's identity like sexual preference, their political affiliations that should not be apparent if one chooses not to disclose those. With AI, this kind of information can be extracted through gross violations of privacy. The ordinary citizen cannot do anything about these measures because they aren't even aware of it. Citizens who are concerned about their data should have the means to protect against being surveilled by the government while be functioning parts of society. They should not be forced to live off the grid in an isolated part of the world.
