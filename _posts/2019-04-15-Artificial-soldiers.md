Artificial intelligence has started to penetrate all aspects of society. Ever since the Comic series Iron and the Terminator series, AI soldiers and body suits have facinated people and who they will check the future of human conflict. There have been a lot of debates on the advantages of AI weapons and how they will change the landscape of human conflict but I personally believe that humans lives cannot be compared to machines and thus a machine should never be allowed to take a human life for offensive or aggression purposes.

AI can help prevent incidents like the [this](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/afghanistan-kunduz-trauma-center-bombing) but even current autonomous vehicles and weapon systems need a human to make the final decision. This helps prevent colletaral but I believe that the human cost of wars make people reluctant to war. If that cost is removed and an entity is given the opportunity to engage in conflict while being gauranteed that there will be no loss of human life, war will become much more common. No amount of machine distruction can be equated to that on a human life.

I believe the way to proceed is enhancements of human abilities with AI. AI can help suplement humans in areas that we are not good at. This will enable use to make less mistakes while having the human element in decisions.
