The debate betweem government surveillance, civil liberties and privacy has been continuing for decades. With the exponential growth of smart phones and the internet, a large porportion of the population can be tracked at all times. Their interests can be calculated, their routes predicted and more imporatantly with the big data that is available, some impressive predictive modes can be created. The problem with this kind of access to data is oversight. At this moment, we don't even know the true power of AI. Everyday, new models and techniques are being invented and remarkable results achieved.

The current consensus in AI is nicely illustrated by Peter Norvig's paper [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf). Even simple machine learning techniques can be used with enough data to replicate the results of much more complicated algorithms which have limited data. Many governments have started to stockpile on citizen data in the hopes of mining the data to general insights but becuase of the technical nature of this information and the rapid developments in AI, legislation is far behind.
